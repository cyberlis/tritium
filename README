tritium -- a tabbed/tiling window manager.

tritium is a tiling/tabbed window manager for the X Window System
inspired by the ion window manager.  It was written completely from
scratch in python and shares no actual code with ion.

tritium is implemented in python using the plwm ("pointless window
manager") library, which is available here:
 	http://plwm.sourceforge.net

please read INSTALL for installation instructions

Configuration for tritium is by default in /etc/X11/tritium/config,
you can override this by copying this file to $HOME/.tritium or
$HOME/.config/tritium
