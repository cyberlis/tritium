note: MORE_TODO_ITEMS=$(grep -r TODO *)

* Add completion to query.py
  for instance, runCommand should show completions from expanding
  PATH, runSSH should show completions from known_hosts

* help screen
  a way to pop up a window showing the current keybindings

* Config reload
  we really should have a way to reload the config files.

* floating frames
  ** need to decide how to integrate floting frames.  here are some options:
    *** make a "floating frame" tab in the tab bar which contains all the floating windows
    *** make a "floating workspace" containing nothing but the floating frame

* Saved layouts
  well we have the starts of a way to have predefined layouts in
  ~/.tritium/layout.py, bot no way to save a layout yet

* Need to move the fonts / colors to .Xresources

* Statusbar / dock
  If we just allow the user to specify a static area on the screen
  which isn't used by frames, the user can reuse functionality from
  other docs/panels such as gnome_panel

* Dragging tabs to other workspaces
  When you start dragging a tab, the hit a key to switch to another
  workspace, you should be able to drop the tab on that workspace.  It
  seems like currently, when you are dragging, workspace switching
  keys are ignored.

* Get menus working
  we at least have a debian menu now when you hit f12, but we should
  have menus for stuff like "close window"

* fullscreen current window
  hit a key and make the current window zoom to fullscreen, hit the
  same key to restore the previous layout

* xinerama support
  looking through the archives of the PLWM ml, it looks like support
  for xinerama under plwm has been worked on, but afaik, no code has
  yet been checked in.

* find application by name
  ** I need to be able to hit 'C-j e' to switch to emacs or launch one if its not running
  ** plpwm in the plwm examples has such a function
