* reparenting
  we should be decorating both tabs and titlebars by reparenting
  windows, right now we just crudely sticking new not related top
  level windows onto the screen.

* Add completion to query.py
  for instance, runCommand should show completions from expanding
  PATH, runSSH should show completions from known_hosts

* Add floating frames
  ** code to handle floating frames has already been written, it is just currently dead code.
     one can swith to using a floating frame on startup by switching:
        self.current_frame = self.frame = TabbedFrame( self.screen, 0, 0, screen.root_width, screen.root_height )
     to 
        self.current_frame = self.frame = FloatingFrame( self.screen, 0, 0, screen.root_width, screen.root_height )

  ** need to decide how to integrate floting frames.  here are some options:
    *** make a "floating frame" tab in the tab bar which contains all the floating windows
    *** make a "floating workspace" containing nothing but the floating frame

* Figure out why we're not getting ButtonPress events in the client area
  ** were getting ButtonPress events in the client border, just not in the client window itself
  
  Actually we get them in some instances, if you, for instance create
  an xmessage, we get the ButtonPress events in all of the client area
  except for the text area containing the message.

  This might go away once we are properly reparenting

* I want shift+super+{h,j,k,l} to 'throw' windows into other frames like shift+super+{h,l} do in wmii-3

* Saved layouts

* Need to move the fonts / colors to .Xresources

* Statusbar / dock
  If we just allow the user to specify a static area on the screen
  which isn't used by frames, the user can reuse functionality from
  other docs/panels such as gnome_panel

* Dragging tabs to other workspaces
  When you start dragging a tab, the hit a key to switch to another
  workspace, you should be able to drop the tab on that workspace.  It
  seems like currently, when you are dragging, workspace switching
  keys are ignored.

* Get menus working
  we at least have a debian menu now when you hit f12

* fullscreen current window
  hit a key and make the current window zoom to fullscreen, hit the
  same key to restore the previous layout

* xinerama support

* find application by name
  ** I need to be able to hit 'C-j e' to switch to emacs or launch one if its not running
  ** plpwm in the plwm examples has such a function
