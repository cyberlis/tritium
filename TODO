* Add completion to query.py
  for instance, runCommand should show completions from expanding
  PATH, runSSH should show completions from known_hosts

* floating frames
  ** need to decide how to integrate floting frames.  here are some options:
    *** make a "floating frame" tab in the tab bar which contains all the floating windows
    *** make a "floating workspace" containing nothing but the floating frame

* Saved layouts

* Need to move the fonts / colors to .Xresources

* Statusbar / dock
  If we just allow the user to specify a static area on the screen
  which isn't used by frames, the user can reuse functionality from
  other docs/panels such as gnome_panel

* Dragging tabs to other workspaces
  When you start dragging a tab, the hit a key to switch to another
  workspace, you should be able to drop the tab on that workspace.  It
  seems like currently, when you are dragging, workspace switching
  keys are ignored.

* Get menus working
  we at least have a debian menu now when you hit f12

* fullscreen current window
  hit a key and make the current window zoom to fullscreen, hit the
  same key to restore the previous layout

* xinerama support

* find application by name
  ** I need to be able to hit 'C-j e' to switch to emacs or launch one if its not running
  ** plpwm in the plwm examples has such a function
